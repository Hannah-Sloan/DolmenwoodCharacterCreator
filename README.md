### [TRY IT HERE](https://hannah-sloan.github.io/DolmenwoodCharacterCreator/)

This is a tool to help make characters in the table top roleplaying game, [Dolmenwood](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/dolmenwood). 

## Features

- Roll ability scores. 3d6 down the line. See each's Ability Modifier.
- Be notified when rolled ability scores qualifies for the optional Subpar Characters Rule.
- Get Class recommendations, based on the XP bonus or penalty granted from that class's Prime Abilities
- Use the Adjust Ability Scores rule to raise your character's Prime Abilities. Dynamically see when this results in a higher XP bonus.
- Choose your alignment from your class's allowed options.
- See each Kindred's 'favorability' with your class. See which Kindreds (if any) are restricted from playing your class.

## Why?

Personally, I found character creation to have one issue. Each Kindred has class preferences, and each Class has Prime Abilities (or "Ability preferences"). When creating characters in the prescribed order:

​	*(Ability Scores -> Kindred -> Class)*

It is often impossible to pick one class that satisfies your Ability Scores and your Kindred. 

This tool attempts to bring relevant information forward, dynamically, when you need it. There's no way to make a Chaotic Friar Grimalkin - a completely restricted alignment-class-race combination. I reorder character creation as follows:

​	*(Ability Scores -> Class -> Kindred )*

This way your ability scores (which you get little choice in) inform your class decision, and your choice of Kindred (which you may choose freely compared to your Ability Scores) can be based upon your class choice, instead of the other way around.

However, the class preferences of each Kindred are not easy to reference *by class*. You must check each Kindred's 'Choosing A Class' entry and look to see if it references your chosen class. This tool automates that process as well. Allowing you to quickly reference each Kindred's 'favorability' with a chosen class.

In all honesty, selecting a 'subpar' ability score-class combination is not an issue player's really need to be concerned with. Therefore choosing a kindred and letting it inform your class decision is perfectly reasonable approach to character creation. Coming from dnd 5e this was a little hard to grasp. This project helped me explore Dolmenwood's approach to character creation and hopefully it will help you create a novice adventurer, ready to brave the befuddling Dolmenwood.

## Is this Official?

No. I am no way associated with Dolmenwood or it's creators. 

It should be noted that the fonts, colors, layout, and design is heavily... "inspired" by the official books. The text and rules are likewise... "borrowed". This tool should not be a substitute of the books 

At the time of writing the Dolmenwood is still in its crowdfunding stage. This tool is based on information found in the 'Dolmenwood Preview' pdf and the unfinished material released to patreon supporters. As such all the information is subject to change. 

## Help Me

My background is in game development, and this was my first web development project. It could evidently use improvement. If you like this tool and want to improve it, please fork, clone, pull request, etc. and make your own or improved version. I do apologize for the code.
